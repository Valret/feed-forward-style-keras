# feed-forward-style-keras
Implementation of feed-forward style transfer with keras and tensorflow based on [this paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/papers/eccv16/JohnsonECCV16.pdf). Actually this code can be used as classical style transfer by disabling model's transform part and setting one training image as `tf.Variable`.

### Examples:
